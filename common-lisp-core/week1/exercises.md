Exercise 1
---

Before executing the forms given below, guess the results. Next,
execute the code. Did you get it right? 

*Goal:* Understanding basic Common Lisp syntax.

Exercise 2
---

Read up on the [format
function](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_format.htm)
and its [format
strings](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/a-few-format-recipes.html). It's
a very powerful function, don't let yourself be overwhelmed by the
many options (unless you want to of course). Now try to figure out
what the following expression will print (and what it will return):

    (format t "~5,'0d" 123)

Now try it out. How would you have to change the above code to
actually return the formatted number as a string?

Exercise 3
---

If the number 979000000 is a person's age in seconds. How old would he or
she be in years? Display the result with two decimal places
(e.g. 17.23).

_Note:_ The might be a handy format directive for this purpose.

Exercise 4
---

 Write a Lisp program that tells you how many minutes there are in a
 year (do not bother with leap years just yet).

Exercise 5
--- 

Something about `let`.
