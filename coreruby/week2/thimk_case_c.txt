The variable `x` has been the left-hand side of an assignment, so the symbol is known (although nothing got assigned, hence the value `nil`). In this modified example

    if false
      x = pqr
      pqr = foo
    end
    puts x
    puts pqr
    puts foo

we now get two `nil` values and an error on `foo`.
